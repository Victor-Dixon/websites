# File: open_ai_utils.py
# Location: C:\TheTradingRobotPlugWeb\Scripts\Utilities\
# Description: This module provides an interface to interact with OpenAI's API for various utility functions in the TheTradingRobotPlug project. The `OpenAIUtils` class includes methods for:
# - **Feature Suggestions**: Generating new derived features based on existing financial indicators to enhance trading models.
# - **Hyperparameter Recommendations**: Suggesting optimal hyperparameters for a specified model to improve performance.
# - **Model Performance Reporting**: Creating detailed reports on model performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²) with suggestions for improvement.
# - **Anomaly Detection**: Recommending effective methods for detecting and handling anomalies in financial time series data.
# - **Trading Strategy Proposals**: Suggesting potential trading strategies based on time series data analysis.
# - **Risk Management**: Offering strategies for managing and mitigating trading risks.
# - **Chat Interface**: Providing a conversational interface to interact with users for queries related to trading and model development.

# The class uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model for generating responses and recommendations.
